## Overview

This repository contains codes exploring fundamental Node.js concepts. It covers topics from basic Node.js setup to building web applications with Express:-
* Getting started with Node.js
* Node modules
* Synchronous & Asynchronous programming
* Callbacks
* Using Express
* Routing
* EJS Template engine

## Setup

1.  **Install Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3.  **Run Examples:** You can run each file using `node filename.js` (e.g., `node express.js`).

## Files Demonstration

* **express.js:** Demonstrates a basic Express.js server setup[cite: 1]. This relates to "Getting started with Node.js" and "Using Express".
* **express-route.js:** Illustrates routing in Express.js, including handling different routes and URL parameters[cite: 2]. Covers "Routing" within the "Using Express" topic.
* **file-read.js:** Shows asynchronous file reading using Node.js's `fs` module. Demonstrates "Asynchronous programming" and the use of "Node modules".
* **file-write.js:** Demonstrates asynchronous file writing using Node.js's `fs` module.  Also relates to "Asynchronous programming" and "Node modules".
* **module\_a.js:** Provides an example of creating and exporting a Node.js module. Directly covers "Node modules".
* **os.js:** Shows how to use the `os` module to get operating system information. Demonstrates "Node modules".
* **route.js:** Implements basic routing using Node.js's built-in `http` module. Covers "Routing" without Express.
* **package.json:** Lists project dependencies (express, ejs). Important for "Node modules" (dependency management) and "Using Express" (express is a dependency).
* **package-lock.json:** Ensures consistent installations.  Related to "Node modules".
* **mylife.txt:** A simple text file used for file read/write examples.
    
* _Note: While the files demonstrate Express and package.json includes ejs, there isn't a file explicitly focused on EJS templating in this set._
