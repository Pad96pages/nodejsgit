This repository contains codes exploring fundamental Node.js concepts. 
It covers topics from basic Node.js setup to building web applications with Express:-
* Getting started with Node.js
* Node modules
* Synchronous & Asynchronous programming
* Callbacks
* Using Express
* Routing
* EJS Template engine

## Setup

1.  **Install Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3.  **Run Examples:** You can run each file using `node filename.js` (e.g., `node express.js`).

Node.js files demonstrating:-
1. Express.js: Basic server and routing (express.js, express-route.js)
2. HTTP Routing: Basic routing without Express (route.js)
3. File I/O: Reading and writing files (file-read.js, file-write.js)
4. Modules: Creating and using modules (module_a.js)
5. OS Module: Getting OS info (os.js)
6. Dependencies: package.json and package-lock.json for managing project dependencies.

NOTE: index.js file is created in the views.
